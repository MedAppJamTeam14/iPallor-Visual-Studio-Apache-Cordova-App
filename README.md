# iPallor-App

iPallor detects optic disk temporal pallor by analyzing a retinal image on your phone. In doing so it bypasses the need for a large, expensive, and immobile machine that is only available in well established medical facilities, and thus greatly empowers clinicians to quickly and easily test for damage.

# Technologies Used

Uses visual studio tools for apache cordova with the ionic ui framework. Most of the code for the style and function of the app is in the WWW folder.
